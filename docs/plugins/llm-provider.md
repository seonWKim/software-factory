# LLMProvider

What it does: single model calls without tools (for example classification). Refuses `prod` data.

Plugins:

- `claude-cli`: `ClaudeCliLLMProvider`, one turn through the Claude Code CLI on the subscription login (D2).
  - Enable: `"plugins": { "llm": "claude-cli", ... }`.
  - Secrets: `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). Settings: `models` (`cheap`, `standard`, `strong`); the `claude` CLI on `PATH`.

Smoke-test with `npm run factory -- llm-check` (`--model standard` or `--model strong` for the other classes): it builds the configured provider through the registry (`Plugins.llm()`) and makes two small real calls, one plain and one with an output schema, every printed line egress-scanned first. `npm run factory -- doctor --llm` runs the same check as one doctor line; plain `doctor` makes no model call. No factory workflow step calls the provider.

Switch back / disable: `"llm": "claude-cli"`.
