# RFC 0015 refactor: progress

The current snapshot of the architecture while the factory moves to RFC 0015 (an event-driven factory of
independent, restartable actors). The RFC and the target schema live in `~/Desktop/software-factory-rfcs/`
(`0015-event-driven-factory.md`, `0015-target-schema.sql`). This file says what exists **today** on the
`refactor/rfc-0015` branch, what is still legacy, and what comes next. It is updated with every milestone.

The refactor runs in the main session, not through the factory. The factory (supervisor, cron loops,
background agents) is paused until it lands.

## Milestones

| M | Milestone | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Foundations: shared kernel, architecture tests + ratchet, schema snapshot, migration safety kit | in progress |
| 1 | Table renames to `<component>_` prefixes (backup → expand → backfill → verify → swap) | — |
| 2 | Components and discovery (`src/<component>/`, `index.ts`, no central wiring) | — |
| 3 | Bus (EventBus, sql plugin, topics, outbox/inbox, retry scheduler) | — |
| 4 | Inbound (adapters + normalizers; GitHub sync out of the controller) | — |
| 5 | Controller units (router + pure `decide()` units; `controller.ts` gone) | — |
| 6 | Workers (step journal, ExecutionEngine, timeouts, heartbeat/reaper) | — |
| 7 | Outbound (aggregators, batches, delivery handlers; no forge writes in workers) | — |
| 8 | Merge queue | — |
| 9 | Identity and passports | — |
| 10 | Extension points (hooks, roles, Rule of Two, settings-monotonic) | — |
| 11 | Cleanup (contract migrations, docs, empty ratchet lists) | — |

## Architecture today

```
src/
  shared/              NEW  envelope (ids-only payloads), defineHandler, defineTopic (+ partitions, backoff),
                            ticks/ (TickGenerator; time-based and manual plugins). Imports nothing outside itself.
  runtime/registry/    NEW  discovery of *.handler.ts and *.topic.ts; dispatch rules (a command has one handler)
  state/               NEW  SqlDriver interface (moved from impl/store/sql/driver.ts), schema snapshots,
                            migrate/backup.ts (backup, verify a copy, restore; order-independent checksums)
  core/                LEGACY  controller.ts (4,959 lines), worker.ts (3,098), policy, coordination, ...
  impl/                LEGACY  plugin implementations (store, github, slack, sandbox, runner, ...)
  interfaces/          LEGACY  FactoryStore (136 methods) and the other plugin interfaces
  ui/                  LEGACY  HTTP API and pages for web/
  compose.ts, main.ts  LEGACY  hand wiring and the CLI switch
schema/                NEW  sqlite.sql, mysql.sql: generated snapshots of a fresh migration (npm run schema:snapshot)
tests/architecture/    NEW  dependency-direction, file-budget, no-clock, table-ownership, schema-snapshot,
                            registry-rules (handler-layout, dispatch-coverage, topic-ownership, envelope-shape),
                            migration-naming; known-violations/*.json are the ratchet lists (they only shrink)
```

Data flow is still the legacy one: the controller tick polls sources, decides, writes the store and the
thread outbox; workers claim runs from the store and push/open PRs themselves.

## Ratchet (known violations)

| Test | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| table-ownership | 42 | every legacy table except worker_processes and worker_pauses is unprefixed (M1 renames them) |
| file-budget | see `known-violations/file-budget.json` | src files over 600 lines |
| no-clock | see `known-violations/no-clock.json` | legacy clock reads and timers |
| dependency-direction | 0 | new components only; legacy folders are checked by tests/boundaries.test.ts |

## Decisions taken while implementing

- 2026-11-08: the merge queue moved after the controller units (M8), so it is built once on the new structure.
- 2026-11-08: table renames come first (M1), so every later step writes SQL against the final names.
- 2026-11-08: the registry lives in `src/runtime/registry/`, not `src/shared/`, because discovery reads the file
  system and `shared/` does no I/O.
- 2026-11-08: the time-based tick generator is a plain class for now; it becomes a `*.plugin.ts` choice when the
  plugin registry moves into the runtime (M2).

## Next

M0: remaining pieces, then M1 (the timestamped migration runner, `runtime_schema_migrations`, `runtime_backups`,
the rename migration with verify, and the store's SQL switched to the new names).
